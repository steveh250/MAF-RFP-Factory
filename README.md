# RFP Factory

## Background
This started off as a dumping ground for experiments using the new Micrososft Agent Framework (MAF) to see if MAF would work offline.  The initial PoC involved Ollama (with Qwen3:8b), the MAF code and a Docling MCP server to parse out a PDF (an RFP) and generate answers.  I then added basic RAG (using Chromadb) to store the extracted text.  This developed into the direction I am now taking of building PoC's for both sides of an RFP factory (having been on both sides of the RFP process many, many times I know how painful both sides of the process can be).

The factory analogy has been used as I imagine these working in the background, e.g. via CRON jobs, monitoring folders for documents and automatically creating the responses or assessments and dropping the drafts into a folder for further human processing.

### Factory - RFP Response Generator
The thinking behind this is that it will truly be a factory, a self contained Python script that is woken up by a cron job (with a shell script wrapper), that looks in two folders for an RFP to process and company information, it then builds an RFP response into a Word document which it saves - useful for sales or pursuit teams to reduce the amount of time spent on preparing RFP responses.

### Factory - RFP Response Assessor
This is for the procurement teams that receive the RFP's and generate an initial assessment based on a rubric.  This is useful in improving the RFP assessment process to reduce effort and increase throughput (what typically happens is that procurement teams have an initial set of criteria to filter out responses before they are passed to the actual assessors but usually have limited expertise to do anything but a basic assessment) - this assement agent will help filter out weak responses as well as provide an initial assessment to the downstream human assessors.

# Development Tasks

## RFP Response Generator

## Phase 1 - PoC MVP
 - [X] Get rid of the async error messages.
 - [X] Add RAG (Chroma) for input data to ground questions.
 - [X] Add Word document creation to store output.
 - [X] Pass files in as parameters (with defaults).
 - [X] Try larger Qwen models (14b runs just fine - needed context window modified).
 - [X] Improved prompts to reduce instruction and user prompt overlap (got better responses and less reasoning).
 - [X] Built version to extract RFP contents into JSON and then loop through the individual JSON sections and develop responses (replicates what I do manually with GenAI's), all consolidated into a final Word document.  This worked really well and was a major enhancement.
 	- [X] Keep JSON as intermediate format as it's entriely possible the RFP reponse could feed into an automated assessor that would ingest the JSON and assess it (easier to assess than parsing a Word document).
  - [X] RAG ingestion by Agent is now more predictible - giving one agent the responsibility of ingestion into RAG of the Company info AND JSON extraction of the requirements was too predictable (still hallucinating though).
  - [X] Increase context window size with 130k (128,000 tokens) model and have improved the responses as now we have multiple chunks being found and processed from the RAG retrieval so response quality has improved.  Problem was likely that the context window was too small to process the docling converted company ionfo document - with the document being processed within the context window there is more data to chunck and therefore more responses to the RAG query and data for the prompts.  It wasn't an hallucination problem but a context window and data problem.

### Phase 2 - Enhancements (In Priority Order)
 - [X] Split the Agents up into different agents and setup a controller Agent to use A2A to call the individual Agents with specific, tightly controlled scopes of work.
 	- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/user-guide/agents/agent-types/a2a-agent?pivots=programming-language-python
	- Flask based for async i/o (amongst other things)
   	- **Completed in other repo**
 - [X]  QA Agent
 	- Add a QA agent to the script - client persona based (maybe use a diffrerent model for QA).
  	- Add ability to pull in files that describe the customer (e.g. Strategic Plans etc.) and use them to support the QA persona (i.e. have it work through the RFP JSON to see if there is anything to add to the RFP response that would increase the liklihood of winning the RFP).
	- Is there a way to make this self-learning - have the QA agent recommend prompt changes to include in the RFP agent to improve it's work? (E.G. have access to the RFP agent prompts which get read in each time by the RFP agent.)
   	- **Completed in other repo**
   	- 
**Moved future Agentic development to another repo**

## RFP Response Assessor

### Phase 1 - PoC MVP
 - [X] Create basic assessor using the Response generator as a template - change the prompts.

# Observations

## Capturing Reasoning
Initially I didn't want to capture the reasoning information in the Word document but quickly changed my mind as:
 - _Prompt performance_: Watching the Ollama logs and seeing the number and duration of the inferences I could see, combined with the reasoning output, that there is an opportunity to improve the performance by making the prompts clearer.
 - _Transparency_: For the person receiving the output the reasoning provides some insight into the models reasoning process.

## Model Size
I optimized the prompt as much as possible and the 8B model was giving good answers.  I upgraded to the Qwen:14B model and it made a massive difference - thought more clearly and when it encountered errors provided much clearer explanations of the errors and selected tools more clearly.

## Docling Failures
I was getting Docling failures and it looked like the model was calling Docling with an incorrect max_size format.  Added the following to the agent prompt to solve that.
```
Do NOT pass numeric values for max_size, either omit max_size entirely or pass it as a string, e.g. "100"; if you are unsure, omit max_size so the default is used.
```
## RAG Problem when used for RFP Processing
For version 4b11400 I worked on forcing the agent to load the RFP into the vector database but it didn't do a very good job at all of extracting the requirements from the vector database - it did a much better job when it seemed to just process the Docling markdown.  Modified to remove the RFP load into Chroma and on ensuring only the company information was stored in the vector database.  This may have worked better to store the JSON in the vector database after processing the RFP with some form of prefix to identify it as a requirement - I can't imagine this being an issue unless the RFP was absolutely huge.

## Question Answering
It became apparent, even after upgrading to the 14B model that the approach of answering all the RFP requirements in one go by an agent wasn't going to work (maybe a function of the context window size of the smaller models).  Took a different approach of using the model to extract the requirements and then process them one at a time (an approach I have had a lot of success with when manually responding to RFP's and Grant Requests using models) - this improved the quality of the output dramatically and it also, as expected, took longer to generate a document as the Agent was being called for each JSON element (RFP requirement).

## Ollama truncating prompts
Noticed this in the Ollama logs: 'Nov 02 22:57:57 ollama[1011]: time=2025-11-02T22:57:57.174Z level=WARN source=runner.go:159 msg="truncating input prompt" limit=4096 prompt=7268 keep=4 new=4096'
 - Didn't seem able to use things like extra_body in the Python code for the Ollama setup to be able to modify the context window size.
 - Found this article: https://github.com/ollama/ollama/issues/8099
 - Applied these changes - including changing the model name in the Python script and worked much better.
 - Also saw the same message with the 14B model, used same approach to fix.
 - Later increased the context window size to 128,000 tokens which improved the responses - due to more data being available in the context window form the docling server to ingest into the RAG data store.
